# checkyourself

Check yourself is the beginnings of a checkers game written by [Jacob
Chapman](https://github.com/jkchapman) and
[myself](https://github.com/timpeskett) in preparation for the 2016 Global
Game Jam. The main goal of creating this game was to familiarise ourselves
with libGDX, a Java game programming library.

The game as it exists now took about four hours. It is still not yet properly
playable, but is in good condition to be carried on someday and completed.

The game does enforce the 'have to take if possible' rule.  Most of the
functionality for king-ing pieces is implemented. Unfortunately, it does not
enforce turn order, which makes it somewhat unplayable as an actual checkers
game. This addition would not be too taxing, and will hopefully be made one
day when Jacob or I are motivated enough to do it.
